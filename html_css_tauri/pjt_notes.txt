- created ui folder
  - created index.html

- installed tauri-cli
  - run cargo tauri init to setup the pjt at same level as ui folder 
  - for dev_server url and web assets provide the ../ui folder path.
  - frontend serving + building leave it blank

- run cargo tauri dev at ui folder level, to start the project. This will launch the index.html content 
in the front end

- adding withGlobalTauri: true to tauri.conf.json will inject the tauri api to the frontend, so javascript 
can call them

- The project completes by modifying the main.rs invoke commands.
