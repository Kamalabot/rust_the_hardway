// Explanation:
// Cow<T> stands for "Clone on Write" and is an
// enum that represents either a reference to
// immutable data or an owned copy of the data.

// It is used to optimize situations where you
// want to avoid cloning data until absolutely
// necessary.

// Cow can be used with types like str and
// Vec, and it provides a way to handle immutable
// and mutable states efficiently.

// Challenges Solved:
// Efficient Cloning: Avoids unnecessary cloning by using a reference as long as possible and only cloning when the data needs to be modified.
// Performance: Helps in cases where you might be working with data that is frequently read but occasionally modified
use std::borrow::Cow;

fn main() {
    let s = "Hello, world!".to_string(); // owned data
    let cow1: Cow<str> = Cow::Borrowed("Hello, world!"); // borrowed data
    let cow2: Cow<str> = Cow::Owned(s); // owned data
                                        // Both of these variables
                                        // Using Cow to work with both borrowed and owned data

    println!("cow1: {}", cow1);
    println!("cow2: {}", cow2);

    let mut data = Cow::Borrowed("Hello, world!");
    let mut data1 = Cow::Borrowed(&data);
    let mut_data = data.to_mut(); // Clones the data if itâ€™s currently borrowed
    mut_data.push_str(" How are you?");
    println!("Modified data: {}", mut_data);

    let res1 = manipulate_string("Super Mario");
    let res2 = manipulate_string("foo in far way land...");
    println!("The res1 is {}", res1);
    println!("The res2 is {}", res2);
}

fn manipulate_string(s: &str) -> Cow<str> {
    // shows the Clone on Write scenario
    if s.contains("foo") {
        Cow::Owned(s.replace("foo", "bar"))
    } else {
        Cow::Borrowed(s)
    }
}
