# Package and Crate
A package is a project which you create with Cargo (in most cases), so it contains a `Cargo.toml` file in it.

1. ðŸŒŸ Create a package  with below layout:
```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ main.rs

1 directory, 2 files
```

```toml
# in Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-package"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

> Note! We will use this package across the whole chapter as a practice project.

2. ðŸŒŸ Create a package with below layout:
```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ lib.rs

1 directory, 2 files
```

```toml
# in Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-package1"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

> Note! This package could be safely removed due to the first one's existence.

## Crate
A crate is a binary or library. The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of the crate.

In package `hello-package`, there is binary crate with the same name as the package : `hello-package`, and `src/main.rs` is the crate root of this binary crate.

Similar to `hello-package`, `hello-package1` also has a crate in it, however, this package doesn't contain a binary crate but a library crate, and `src/lib.rs` is the crate root.

4. ðŸŒŸ
```rust,editable
/* FILL in the blank with your ANSWER */

// Q: What's the name of the library crate in package `hello-package1`?
// A: __
```


5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Add a library crate for `hello-package` and describe it's files tree below:
```shell,editable
# FILL in the blanks
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ __
```

After this step, there should be two crates in package `hello-package`: **a binary crate and a library crate, both with the same name as the package**.

6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ A package can contain at most one library crate, but it can contain as many binary crates as you would like by placing files in `src/bin` directory: **each file will be a separate binary crate with the same name as the file**.

```shell,editable
# Create a package which contains 
# 1. three binary crates: `hello-package`, `main1` and `main2`
# 2. one library crate
# describe the directory tree below
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ __
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ __
â”œâ”€â”€ tests # directory for integrated tests files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ some_integration_tests.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ benches # dir for benchmark files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ simple_bench.rs
â””â”€â”€ examples # dir for example files
    â””â”€â”€ simple_example.rs
```

Yep, as you can see, the above package structure is very standard and is widely used in many Rust projects.
