# Iterator
The iterator pattern allows us to perform some tasks on a sequence of items in turn. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished.

## for and iterator
```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    for x in v {
        println!("{}",x)
    }
}
```

In the code above, You may consider `for` as a simple loop, but actually it is iterating over a iterator. 

By default  `for` will apply the `into_iter` to the collection, and change it into a iterator. As a result, the following code is equivalent to previous one:
```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    for x in v.into_iter() {
        println!("{}",x)
    }
}
```

```rust,editable
/* Refactoring the following code using iterators */
fn main() {
    let arr = [0; 10];
    for i in 0..arr.len() {
        println!("{}",arr[i]);
    }
}
```

2. ðŸŒŸ One of the easiest ways to create an iterator is to use the range notion: `a..b`.
```rust,editable
/* Fill in the blank */
fn main() {
    let mut v = Vec::new();
    for n in __ {
       v.push(n);
    }

    assert_eq!(v.len(), 100);
}
```

## next method
All iterators implement a trait named `Iterator` that is defined in the standard library:
```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;

    // Methods with default implementations elided
}
```

And we can call the `next` method on iterators directly.

```rust,editable
/* Fill the blanks and fix the errors.
Using two ways if possible */
fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2];

    assert_eq!(v1.next(), __);
    assert_eq!(v1.next(), __);
    assert_eq!(v1.next(), __);
}
```

## into_iter, iter and iter_mut
In the previous section, we have mentioned that `for` will apply the `into_iter` to the collection, and change it into a iterator. However, this is not the only way to convert collections into iterators.

`into_iter`, `iter`, `iter_mut`, all of them can convert a collection into iterator, but in different ways.

- `into_iter` consumes the collection, once the collection has been consumed, it is no longer available for reuse, because its ownership has been moved within the loop.
- `iter`, this borrows each element of the collection through each iteration, thus leaving the collection untouched and available for reuse after the loop
- `iter_mut`, this mutably borrows each element of the collection, allowing for the collection to be modified in place.

fn main() {

}
```

            &mut "Ferris" => "There is a rustacean among us!",
            _ => "Hello",
        }
    }

    println!("names: {:?}", names);
}

    if let Some(v) = values_iter.__{
        __
    }

    assert_eq!(values, vec![0, 2, 3]);
}
```


## Creating our own iterator
We can not only create iterators from collection's types, but also can create iterators by implementing the `Iterator` trait on our own types.

**Example**
```rust
struct Counter {
    count: u32,
}

impl Counter {
    fn new() -> Counter {
        Counter { count: 0 }
    }
}

impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        if self.count < 5 {
            self.count += 1;
            Some(self.count)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut counter = Counter::new();

    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(1));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(2));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(3));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(4));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(5));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), None);
}
```


7. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

```rust,editable
struct Fibonacci {
    curr: u32,
    next: u32,
}

// Implement `Iterator` for `Fibonacci`.
// The `Iterator` trait only requires a method to be defined for the `next` element.
impl Iterator for Fibonacci {
    // We can refer to this type using Self::Item
    type Item = u32;
    
    /* Implement next method */
    fn next(&mut self)
}

// Returns a Fibonacci sequence generator
fn fibonacci() -> Fibonacci {
    Fibonacci { curr: 0, next: 1 }
}

fn main() {
    let mut fib = fibonacci();
    assert_eq!(fib.next(), Some(1));
    assert_eq!(fib.next(), Some(1));
    assert_eq!(fib.next(), Some(2));
    assert_eq!(fib.next(), Some(3));
    assert_eq!(fib.next(), Some(5));
}
```

## Methods that Consume the Iterator
The `Iterator` trait has a number of methods with default implementations provided by the standard library.


### Consuming adaptors
Some of these methods call the method `next`to use up the iterator, so they are called *consuming adaptors*.

```rust,edtiable

/* Fill in the blank and fix the errors */
fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

    // The sum method will take the ownership of the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling next method
    let total = v1_iter.sum();

    assert_eq!(total, __);

    println!("{:?}, {:?}",v1, v1_iter);
}
```


#### Collect
Other than converting a collection into an iterator, we can also `collect` the result values into a collection, `collect` will consume the iterator.


9. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

```rust,editable
/* Make it work */
use std::collections::HashMap;
fn main() {
    let names = [("sunface",18), ("sunfei",18)];
    let folks: HashMap<_, _> = names.into_iter().collect();

    println!("{:?}",folks);

    let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v2 = v1.iter().collect();

    assert_eq!(v2, vec![1, 2, 3]);
}
```


###  Iterator adaptors
Methods allowing you to change one iterator into another iterator are known as *iterator adaptors*. You can chain multiple iterator adaptors to perform complex actions in a readable way.

But because **all iterators are lazy**, you have to call one of the consuming adapters to get results from calls to iterator adapters.

```rust,editable
/* Fill in the blanks */
fn main() {
    let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v2: Vec<_> = v1.iter().__.__;

    assert_eq!(v2, vec![2, 3, 4]);
}
```


11. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

```rust,editable
/* Fill in the blanks */
use std::collections::HashMap;
fn main() {
    let names = ["sunface", "sunfei"];
    let ages = [18, 18];
    let folks: HashMap<_, _> = names.into_iter().__.collect();

    println!("{:?}",folks);
}
```


#### Using closures in iterator adaptors

#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Shoe {
    size: u32,
    style: String,
}

fn shoes_in_size(shoes: Vec<Shoe>, shoe_size: u32) -> Vec<Shoe> {
    shoes.into_iter().__.collect()
}

fn main() {
    let shoes = vec![
        Shoe {
            size: 10,
            style: String::from("sneaker"),
        },
        Shoe {
            size: 13,
            style: String::from("sandal"),
        },
        Shoe {
            size: 10,
            style: String::from("boot"),
        },
    ];

    let in_my_size = shoes_in_size(shoes, 10);

    assert_eq!(
        in_my_size,
        vec![
            Shoe {
                size: 10,
                style: String::from("sneaker")
            },
            Shoe {
                size: 10,
                style: String::from("boot")
            },
        ]
    );
}
```
