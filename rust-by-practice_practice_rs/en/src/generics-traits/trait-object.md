# Trait Object
In [traits chapter](https://practice.rs/generics-traits/traits.html#returning-types-that-implement-traits) we have seen that we can't use `impl Trait` when returning multiple types.

Another limitation of arrays is that they can only store elements of one type. Using enums is not a bad solution when we have a fixed set of types at compile time, but trait objects would be more flexible and powerful.

## Returning Traits with dyn
The Rust compiler needs to know how much space a function's return type requires. Because the different implementations of a trait probably uses different amounts of memory, functions need to either return a concrete type or the same type when using  `impl Trait`, or return a trait object with `dyn`.

trait Bird {
    fn quack(&self) -> String;

struct Duck;
impl Duck {
    fn swim(&self) {
        println!("Look, the duck is swimming")
    }
}
struct Swan;
impl Swan {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Look, the duck.. oh sorry, the swan is flying")
    }
}

impl Bird for Duck {
    fn quack(&self) -> String{
        "duck duck".to_string()
    }
}

impl Bird for Swan {
    fn quack(&self) -> String{
        "swan swan".to_string()
    }
}

fn main() {
    // FILL in the blank.
    let duck = __;
    duck.swim();

    let bird = hatch_a_bird(2);
    // This bird has forgotten how to swim, so below line will cause an error.
    // bird.swim();
    // But it can quak.
    assert_eq!(bird.quack(), "duck duck");

    let bird = hatch_a_bird(1);
    // This bird has forgotten how to fly, so below line will cause an error.
    // bird.fly();
    // But it can quak too.
    assert_eq!(bird.quack(), "swan swan");

    println!("Success!");
}   

// IMPLEMENT this function.
fn hatch_a_bird...

impl Bird for Swan {
    fn quack(&self) {
        println!("{}", "swan swan");

}

fn main() {
    // FILL in the blank to make the code work.
    let birds __;

    for bird in birds {
        bird.quack();
        // When duck and swan turn into Birds, they all forgot how to fly, only remember how to quack.
        // So, the code below will cause an error.
        // bird.fly();
    }
}
```

// FILL in the blanks.
trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self) -> String;
}

impl Draw for u8 {
    fn draw(&self) -> String {
        format!("u8: {}", *self)
    }
}

impl Draw for f64 {
    fn draw(&self) -> String {
        format!("f64: {}", *self)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 1.1f64;
    let y = 8u8;

    // Draw x.
    draw_with_box(__);

    // Draw y.
    draw_with_ref(&y);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn draw_with_box(x: Box<dyn Draw>) {
    x.draw();
}

fn draw_with_ref(x: __) {
    x.draw();
}
```

## Static and Dynamic dispatch
When we use trait bounds on generics, the compiler generates nongeneric implementations of functions and methods for each concrete type that we use in place of a generic type parameter. The code that results from monomorphization is doing static dispatch, which is when the compiler knows what method youâ€™re calling at compile time. 

When we use trait objects, Rust must use dynamic dispatch. The compiler doesnâ€™t know all the types that might be used with the code that is using trait objects, so it doesnâ€™t know which method implemented on which type to call. Instead, at runtime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait object to know which method to call. There is a runtime cost when this lookup happens that doesnâ€™t occur with static dispatch. Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler from choosing to inline a methodâ€™s code, which in turn prevents some optimizations. 

However, we do get extra flexibility when using dynamic dispatch.

```rust,editable

trait Foo {
    fn method(&self) -> String;
}

impl Foo for u8 {
    fn method(&self) -> String { format!("u8: {}", *self) }
}

impl Foo for String {
    fn method(&self) -> String { format!("string: {}", *self) }
}

// IMPLEMENT below with generics.
fn static_dispatch...

// Implement below with trait objects.
fn dynamic_dispatch...

fn main() {
    let x = 5u8;
    let y = "Hello".to_string();

    static_dispatch(x);
    dynamic_dispatch(&y);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

## Object safe
You can only make object-safe traits into trait objects. A trait is object safe if all the methods defined in the trait have the following properties:

- The return type isnâ€™t `Self`.
- There are no generic type parameters.

```rust,editable

// Use at least two approaches to make it work.
// DON'T add/remove any code line.
trait MyTrait {
    fn f(&self) -> Self;
}

impl MyTrait for u32 {
    fn f(&self) -> Self { 42 }
}

impl MyTrait for String {
    fn f(&self) -> Self { self.clone() }
}

fn my_function(x: Box<dyn MyTrait>)  {
    x.f()
}

fn main() {
    my_function(Box::new(13_u32));
    my_function(Box::new(String::from("abc")));

    println!("Success!");
}
```
