This book was designed for easily diving into and getting skilled with Rust, and it's very easy to use: All you need to do is to make each exercise compile without ERRORS and Panics !


## Reading online

- [English](https://practice.rs)
- [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](https://zh.practice.rs)


## Running locally

We use [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) building our exercises. You can run locally with below steps:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:sunface/rust-by-practice.git
$ cargo install mdbook
$ cd rust-by-practice && mdbook serve en/ 
```

## Features

Part of our examples and exercises are borrowed from [Rust By Example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example), thanks for your great works!

Although they are so awesome, we have our own secret weapons :)

- There are three parts in each chapter: examples, exercises and practices

- Besides examples, we have `a lot of exercises`, you can Read, Edit and Run them ONLINE

- Covering nearly all aspects of Rust, such as async/await, threads, sync primitives, optimizing, standard libraries, tool chain, data structures and algorithms etc.

- Every exercise has its own solutions

- The overall difficulties are a bit higher and from easy to super hard: easy ðŸŒŸ medium ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ hard ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ super hard ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

**What we want to do is to fill the gap between learning and getting started with real projects!**
