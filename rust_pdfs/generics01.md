The error occurs because `T` is not defined. The type `T` should be a type that can handle both `u8` and `i8` conversions. You can resolve this by annotating the type of the `Vec` as `i16` or `i32` since both `u8` and `i8` can be converted into these integer types. Here's the fixed code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut numbers: Vec<i16> = Vec::new(); // Specify `i16` as the type for the vector

    let n1: u8 = 42;
    numbers.push(n1.into());
    let n2: i8 = -1;
    numbers.push(n2.into());

    println!("{numbers:?}");
}
```

Now, `u8` and `i8` will be converted to `i16`, and the code will compile correctly.
